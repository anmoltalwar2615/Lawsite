      <h3>Real Estate Sales</h3>
      <p>New York State law states that a real estate transaction must be attended, supervised, and directed by a licensed New York real estate attorney,
        from examining title to signing documents. Lawyer Guo Fengli can provide you with legal services for real estate transactions such as
         commercial buildings, residences, cooperative apartments, and condominiums, and can represent developers, banks, buyers, sellers, 
         cooperative apartment buildings and other transaction entities in the transfer of ownership.</p>

      <h3>Shop Sales</h3>
      <p>Whether you are buying (renting) a newly opened store, or taking over a small business that someone else already has, 
        you must see if the store can be legally opened there. For example, to open a winery depends on whether it is allowed to open
         a winery on the c/o. Even if it is a business that the store is already doing, it cannot be assumed that c/o must meet the regulations.
          Lawyer Guo Fengli is familiar with the legal terms of retail sales and has nearly 20 years of legal service experience.</p>

      <p>The title change can be simply divided into two types: one is paid transfer, which is a normal house sale; the other is free transfer, 
        such as gift. The tax and title insurance issues involved in the two renaming methods are very different. Ownership method: 
        In addition to paying attention to the transfer method, you also need to pay attention to the holding method of the property owner in New York State.</p>
